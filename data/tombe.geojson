They all followed the same sequence of deposits but had been heavily robbed with limited artefactual or skeletal remains present. T1–T3 were minimally visible on the surface before any cleanin g or excavation but the removal of ( L1) revealed them as roughly circular areas of yellow aeolian sand ( T1: (L4); T2: (L5); T3: (L8)) within the grey deposit of ( L2). No clear cuts were discernible until 5–10 cm of the fills w ere removed because ( L2) was degraded and very loose at the upper level; below this, however, the cut s (T1: [L6]; T2: [L7]; T3: [L9]) were clearly identifiable in the compact level of (L153). T19 was not very visible even after the initial clean of the area. However, during excavation the site T19 was located on a path regularly used so underwent a lot of trampling. This accelerated natural processes and the fill became more visibly yellow, helping the identification of the feature. (Continua a pagina 11) Tombs 1, 2, 3, 19. File: AKAP22B_07981 Tomb 1 (a.k.a. Feature 1) Dimensions: Tomb 1 (also labelled as F1 ) was a simple, unmarked, shallow burial in the western extremity of WT1 (Q1A/1B) , roughly circular in shape, measuring 1.4 m (N-S) x 1.2 m (E-W) and 0.26 m in depth. The walls of the cist were vertical, with only the eastern wall sligh tly diverging. It is almost certain that this represented only a portion of the original depth of the burial due to substantial erosion of the surface level since the construction of the tomb. There was no superstructure, although there once might have bee n surface treatment to indicate the presence of the tomb – but no indication of this survives today. The tomb was heavily robbed and the fill (L 4) comprised aeolian sand, which contained: human remains (bone and teeth fragments) ; a fragment of mother -of-pearl; 18 beads (9 OES (including 4 still attached to one another), 5 light blue/ faience, and 4 black beads (stone?) ), including two partially preserved strings of black (stone?) beads. Some possibl e textile fragments were also recovered , although a very crumbly clump (PPA17) against the north wall of the tomb disintegrated upon collection. This was one of only two tombs to contain traces of textile, the other being T19.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "fid": 2, "name": "Feature 15", "typology": "Feature", "long_description": "Feature 15 ( natural ?) Dimensions: Based on the initial cleaning of the area in this season’s excavation, this small area of loose, yellow aeolian sand (L71=L1) was thought to be the upper fill layer of a possible anthropic feature. F urther investigation, however, was inconclusive and the question remained as to whether this was a natural depression. It was a very shallow (max depth: 0.05 m) sub- rectangular/oval depression with no clear cuts evident. The depression is “ cut” into (L10), a fine, white sand layer that is characterised here by medium -hard compaction; the N -NE edges of the feature were made more friable by natural erosion processes and/or repeated trampling that occurred during excavation activities. The proximity of F15 with F14 , located just to SSW, leaves the possibility open that F15 could have been a result of looter disturbance during the damage to F14 . No finds were recovered from this feature.

The base of the feature, on the north side, had a small step higher than the southern part, creating the impression of an irregular profile (rather than the original U-shaped profile). It is uncertain if this can be interpreted as a remnant of the original bottom of the feature undercut by robbers, which potentially also caused the disturbance initially identified as F15 , to the north of F14 (see below F15). The fill of the feature (L68) was aeolian sand with only a few fragments of human bone (Tag6248) recovered from the upper part of the filling, and some artefacts (one Egyptian body sherd: Tag6250; two ochre fragments: Tag6251) from the lowe r part of the filling close to the bottom of the feature.

Investigation of similar features (cuts) during the season made us re- evaluate this interpretation and a cut [ L165] and feature number were assigned. F37 is located at the western -most edge of the cemetery in an isolated position. The feature was a shallow depression (depth: approx. 0.10 m), sub- circular in shape ( 0.12 m (N -S) x 0.20 m (E -W). The cut was through (L2 ) – the degraded form of ( L153) – and through ( L153 ). The fill of the feature was loose, yellow aeolian sand with no associated artefacts or bones. Feature of unknown function. No finds were recovered from this feature. Feature 37.

As with T1 –T3, this is a very shallow burial, probably because the top layer (s) through which it was cut have eroded away and only the lower part of the tomb remained. In its excavated state it appears too shallow to have been a burial but the presence of some organics, human bone, and Pan- Grave related artefacts suggests it was a burial. The fill (L151) of T19 consis ted of a mix of aeolian sand and degraded, friable stone (L2), which was formerly ( L153 ). This tomb contained a greater range of artefacts and organic (1) | (8) | [9] | (2) | (153) | (10) | (3) (1) | (151) | [152] | (2) | (153) | (10) | (3) (Continua a pagina 14) material than T1 –T3 and comprised: numerous shell fragments , human remains, Pan- Grave pottery, Egyptian pottery, lithics (probably a vestige of much earlier activity, which is readily present across the landscape) , quartz flakes, 20 beads (20 OES), textile, and possibl y a small fragment of copper alloy (this needs verification). Animal hide (with ha ir) was found against the northern edge of the tomb (PPA49) and possibly represented a fragment of the lining of the tomb or part of the material in which the body was wrapped. H airs from the hide were found within ( L151) , towards the bottom of the tomb. T his is the only tomb in the cemetery to contain animal fur/hair, and one of only two to contain evidence of textiles (the other being T1). The base of the tomb was very uneven/irregular , which seems to have been caused by overcutting (by up to 20 cm) during robbing activity. This suggests that the looters also expected a deeper tomb. The cist of T19 was cut [ L9] through ( L2) and ( L153 ). These deposits were much more friable at the top of the burial – ( L2) / upper (L153) – making the edge difficult to define. The bottom of the cut appear ed to terminate within ( L153) , whereas the looting overcut continue d into a thin ( L10) and the start of ( L3).

File: AKAP22B_07956 (Continua a pagina 64) Offering Places and Features Two offering places were excavated in the Southern Sector of WT1, one in the southeast In the southeast of WT1 were a series of features ( F23–F31) that seem to relate the second, later phase in the sequence of this cemetery. All but one ( F26) were located southeast of T6 and T8 but northwest of T11 –T16; F26 was located to the west of T15 . In the same trend seen in the north of the site (probable earlier phase), these features occupy the same position relative to the tombs (northwest), and potentially represent offering places or pot emplacements. Offering Place δ Dimensions: Offering Place δ was in the southeastern area of the cemetery, between T13 (to the northeast) , T14 (to the southeast), and T15 (to the southwest). It consist ed of a large and stratified accumulation of ashes and charcoal (L104 , PPA34) beneath three stones found centrally on top of the deposit. Due to the high disturbance that has affected the site, it is not clear whether these rock elements were the residual part of a stone alignment originally related to the offering area or the accidental effect of a displacement due to post -depositional processes (natural erosion/trampling). The multi- layered deposit (L104) became evident upon the removal of (L1) and was on top of ( L3); it is possible – although unlikely – that there was also a thin lens of a degraded version of natural layer ( L78) between (L104) and (L3) but this is not certain . There was a nearby thin layer of such a deposit (see T15 above), but it is unclear whether it extended this far east. Three small, circular pits, all similar in size, were in the vicinity of OPδ (L104): F27 to the east and F28 and F29 to the west (see below). It is unknown whether they had a direct association with OPδ or were part of an accumulation of features in the sa me area. No finds were recovered from OPδ , other than charcoal and ash. A s ample of the burnt deposit (L104) was collected (Tag6420; Tag6438). Offering Place ε Offering Place ε compris ed a shell – a wide, flat mother -of-pearl(?) bivalve shell – set on the ground and surrounded by a series (three or more) large stones (L167) , which were probably part of a more complex stone structure that has since been completely displaced. The offering area is located in an is olated position on the southern fringe of the cemetery area , approximately 2.5 m SE of T17. The fragmentary bivalve shell (Tag6520) was lying with in (L1) or in/at the possible interface between (L1) and (L14), the natural degradation of the ancient alluvial surface layer of the cemetery (L65) on which this feature was probably originally placed.

Based on their spatial proximity, these features seem to be part of a possible “complex” arguably focused on a linear depression ( F23, a possible “trench”) . Around this, four, similarly sized, small holes ( F24, F25 , F30 , F31 ) were arranged in an arc- shaped alignment, emerging from the northern end of the trench ( F23) in a north- easterly direction . The homogeneous characteristics of these four features (sub -circular shape, shallow depth) suggest that they could originally have the same/similar function, although it remains uncertain. Placed between T8 and T11, they may have been related to both burials or, alternative ly, been focused on the later-phase tombs to the southeast. The deposits filling these features were heavily disturbed and the artefacts (see below) were all recorded in a secondary position: loose in the sandy soil matrix. The top fill layers of F24 and F25 were excavated as a single deposit (L115) when excavating F23 because they were all thought to be F23 until the cut edges became clear . Finds from this layer (L115) include : human(?) bone fragments (Tag6470); Egyptian and Middle Nubian pottery (Tag6471); one fragmentary perforated shell (gastropod) (Tag6472); 39 beads (21 ostrich egg -shell, 10 light blue/faience, 8 black (Tag6473). Features 23, 24, 25, 27, 30 and 31, and Tombs 11–13.

It had been very disturbed through looting activity resulting in very few fragmentary human remains, minimal Egyptian pottery, and only three OES beads within the aeolian sand fill (L34). This sand fill had accumulated after the robbing activity, with no evidence of an earlier, pre-robbing fill surviving. The upper level of the tomb cut [ L33] had not survived, suggesting a much shallower burial than it originally would have been. The remaining part of the burial was cut into ( L3), laying beneath ( L1). The bottom of the cist was within (L3). The majority of the base of the tomb, on the south side, extended 0.24 m deeper than the northern part due to the robber cut [ L66] through the original base, creating the impression of a step (0.10 m wide, N- S) within the tomb and therefore an irregular profile (rather than the original U-shaped profile). A large, flat stone was located on the western edge of the cist and lay directly on ( L3); this was potentially a residual element of the original stone ring of the tomb but without the upper part of the tomb surviving it is impossible to say for certain.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "fid": 13, "name": "Tomb 4", "typology": "Tomb", "long_description": "Tomb 4 Dimensions: Tomb 4 was a simple, small, shallow burial in the north of Q3A, roughly circular in shape, measuring 0.95 m (N-S) x 0.83 m (E-W). The bottom of the burial sloped from a depth of 0.15 m in the east, to 0.25 m in the west . The fill of the burial (L15) was aeolian sand with no artefacts and only a few fragments of bone from the upper part of the filling . There were three large stones at the tomb edge, partially overhanging the cist. These could have been part of a superstructure (stone ring) but it was not possible to say for certain because there was a lot of disturbance in the area. They probably originated from a nearby structure, especially as there were several instances of stones piled up at the northern edge of the cemetery. Tomb 4, with Features 6, 11 and 12.

It had a compact, thin, top layer that overlaid a very crumbly sandy level beneath. This was initially thought to be a surviving fragment of a mud preparation layer for a stone ri ng but was actually a small fragment of the ancient alluvial surface (equal to (L65) elsewhere) into which this burial was originally cut [L21]. However, this surface was incredibly degraded and manifested as (L14) making identification of the burial edges difficult. The profile of this tomb was U -shaped with vertical walls, although the cut/wall was missing on the eastern side because of the soft, loose sand (L14) that kept collapsing. The cist was cut into (L32)/(L14), down to the grey sandy deposit of (L 10). No finds were recovered from this tomb and human remains were very few and fragmentary. Offering place α Dimensions: Associated with T4 , 0.5 m to the east, was Offering Place alpha ( OPα ). This was an area of burning, measuring 0.64 m (N -S) x 0.45 m (E -W) and with a depth of 0.11 m. It was cut [ L24] into ( L14) – originally ( L32)/(L65) – and consist ed of a concentration of a fairly compact , reddish- brown deposit with occasional lenses of light grey ash detected at two di fferent elevation points: The first (L13/L13 lower ) was just below the surface aeolian sand of ( L1), on the south side of OPα ; part of ( L13) was eroded and was situated upon/mixed within the sandy fill of ( L16). The second ( L22) was beneath a circular area of loose aeolian yellow sand (L16) underlying ( L1) and above ( L14). The base of OPα is (L14), not reaching ( L10) beneath. OPα was surrounded by a probable stone ring, at the time of excavation comprising five medium -sized stones (L 23) overlying ( L14). One stone element lay directly on ( L22), possibly collapsed from ( L13) or (L1), and another was atop the burnt ( L13), which was probably not its original position. It is not currently known what was burnt at this offering place but samples were taken of both (L13) (Tag6070- 6071) and (L22) (Tag6098) for further analysis. It seems probable that this feature was contemporary with the construction of T4 . No finds were re covered from this feature.

A small concentration of stone slabs, located on the W edge of the pit, lying on (L10) and/or L65 , can be interpreted as residual elements of the original stone alignment outlying the edge of the feature. There was, however, a lot of movement and distur bance of stone near to this area of the cemetery, creating the impression of stone structures (see F9 , F13 , F16 , F17 ). F12 was identified beneath (L1) and had been very disturbed through looting activity and post-depositional processes. Only a single Egyptian pottery body sherd (Tag6117) was found within the fill (L42) of aeolian sand, which had some small stone inclusions. There was no evidence of an earlier fill surviving in a primary position. The feature was cut [L43] through (L65) and (L10). The bottom of the feature was (L10). The function of this feature can be speculated based on its size and shape (infant/child burial) but should be generally considered to be unknown, particularly because of the high level of disturbance.

Depth = 0.85 – 0.90 m Tomb 6 was one of the three largest tombs (the other two being T7 and T8 ), all of which were located at the core of the site. It was a substantial construction comprising a stone ring (L52) arou nd a central burial cist. As with all tombs at this site, it was thoroughly looted and no in -situ remains survived. T6 measured approximately 4.2 m in diameter at the surface, including the stone ring (L52), 1.8 m at the upper sloped cut, and 1.4 m at the vertical cist cut. The upper part of the inner burial cut [ L59] was a sloped cut because of the soft, loose nature of (L10), which was liable to collapse/cascade during or after being dug (a phenomenon experienced by the team during our excavation). By digging the top of the burial shaft in this way it reduced collapse of loose material back into the cist. The tomb cut was muc h more visible in the western part of the tomb, where the harder alluvial deposit (L3) was present. The lower half of the cut became vertical when the more substantial, compact deposits of (L3) and ( L78) were reached. This manner of construction resulted i n a funnel -shaped tomb cut (in profile). Overall, the burial cist cut [ L59] through ( L65), (L10), (L3), (L78). The latter formed the floor of the cist – possibly approaching the interface between ( L78) and bedrock (L164). (Continua a pagina 22) Tomb 6. File: AKAP22B_03594 In the base of the SW edge of the tomb cist was a small, circular cut [L77]. There was no evidence to indicate its function but it was probably a space for an offering at the time of burial. The location of such a feature is unusual, however. In the northeast side of T6 , on the sloping face of the burial cut, was a shallow cut [ L83] for a feature of unknown function, possibly a ledge on which to place offerings . The stone ring of T6 was relatively intact, especially compared to the ring of T8. There was no mud preparation ring present, as was the case for more complex tombs at the Pan - Grave cemeteries of SM14 and WK11. Some tombs (such as T7 and T8 ) demonstrate that the stone rings were constructed directly upon the ancient alluvial surface of ( L65) but this is not evident here because of probable degradation of the layer.

At the base of the cist was a fill layer of pale brown sand (L74) with dark specks that are very probably a result of the natural geology (L78) into which the tomb is cut; at about the same level as the top of ( L74), the wall of the burial cist changes from the light-coloured ( L3) to a dark reddish-brown (in some places nearly black) deposit (L78). This appears to have been a deposit that accumulated after the tomb had been emptied during looting. This interpretation is supported by the fact that several of the recovered bones from this layer were bleached white indicating that they had been exposed to the elements for a period of time. Emphasising the disturbance caused by robbing activity, a mandible (PPA23) was found near the bottom of (L74), against the north wall of the burial cist – protected by the stone ring collapse (L75) – but the maxilla (PPA24) was found at the southern side of the cist. Even if these were from two separate individuals they were not in situ but had been discarded at the sides of the cist. A few botanical remains were recovered within this layer but they appeared to have been blow-in intrusions, rather than original inclusions. There were, however, some fragments of possible ancient matting . Overall relatively few artefactual and botanical remains were recovered from this bottom layer of the burial fill sequence which, again, highlights the comprehensive looting activity that has taken place. Other than the aforementioned items, the recovered material also included: bone fragments, 40 beads (16 OES, 18 light blue/faience, 5 green glazed(?), 1 white shell bead(?)), 1 Egyptian hemispherical cup (fabric Nile 1B, with a potmark on the interior wall?), and some small pieces of charcoal, which may be modern intrusions.

Tomb 7 was one of the largest of the tombs at WT1, commensurate in size with T6 and T8 at the surface level , and visible prior to any excavation or cleaning of the surface deposits. It was located on the south side of T6 , close enough that the two tombs could have been touching but the disturbance to both makes it hard to discern whether this was the case . T7 was not excavat ed due to time constraints; two of the three large tombs had been excavated so it was decided that T7 would provide little additional information, especially as it was undoubtedly looted, and other areas of the cemetery required further investigation. As with T6 and T8 , T7 had a clear superstructure in the form of a stone ring (L107). Although the strong ring was also heavily disturbed at T7 , it provided protection for further evidence of the natural alluvial deposit of ( L65) which survived in large parts beneath (L107) . Given the nature of the natural deposits on which the tomb was constructed, it is probable that it followed the same structure as T6 and T8 : a funnel -shaped profile comprising a sloped cut in the upper level (L10), followed by a vertical central cist once the compact levels below were reached – (L3), (L78); these may have been reached at a higher elevation in the south of T7 because the sequence of natural layers changed in the vicinity, but was not fully determined during the excavation season. The only artefacts recovered from this tomb came from a clean of the surface deposit overlying the stone ring (L166) , comprising: human bone, Pan- Grave and Egyptian pottery, beads ( 40), a bovid horncore fragment, and goat horncore fragments (Tag6614) .

File: AKAP22B_04230 At WT1 the stone rings, when they occur, were constructed directly upon the ancient alluvial surface of ( L65), through which burial cists were cut. However, this layer was substantially degraded (whether through natural erosion, looting activity, or a combination of the two), with its survival largely limited to areas protected by tomb superstructures. The portion of (L65) most intact, which was located to the north of T8 , revealed that this deposit was too substantial in coverage to be a preparation layer for the stone ring, especially when it became evident that ( L14) was the degraded form of ( L65). It is, however, understandable how it would be tempting to interpret ( L65) as a preparation layer when looking at its distribution across the site on a plan. There are two possible interpretations to explain the fill layers within T8 , which largely depend on the nature of one accumulation deposit, ( L64), which was more compact than the rest of the fill sequence within the burial but just as disturbed. The first explanation is that there were two fill sequences corresponding to two looting events. The second is that there was one looting event and that during accumulation a collapse and movement of part of the stone ring resulted in a more compacted area within the burial. These two explanations will be expanded upon below. i) There seemed to be two separate fill events within T8. Evidence of the first was restricted to approximately 0.5 m within the northern side of the tomb’s stone ring and consisted of a greyish -brown sandy deposit (L64), which was relatively compact compared to the other ( later?) accumulations.

{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "fid": 27, "name": "Tomb 10", "typology": "Tomb", "long_description": "Tomb 10 ( a.k.a. Feature 22) Dimensions: Tomb 10 was a heavily looted shallow, sub- circular burial located approximately 1.5 m north of T8 . It consisted of a central cist ( L103) with an upper, very shallow, irregular cut [L101] surrounding it . The latter was probably a result of looting activity rather than having been created during the digging of the tomb to minimise sand slumping into the cist, as was the case for the larger T6 and T8 . The cuts were very fragile and difficult to discern, being cut into soft natural substrate : the main burial cist [ L103] was cut into ( L65), (L3), and probably also ( L10). There was no stone ring evident for T10 and it seems unlikely to have originally existed, but the presence of a few large stones during excavation could have been fr om one that had long since disappeared due to the erosion of the base sediment. The central cist was filled by two deposits: t he bottom of [ L103] was covered with a thin layer of brownish- yellow sand with a lot of small stone inclusions (L121) ; above this was a loose, yellow aeolian sand (L102) with some white lenses (probably from ( L10)) mixed into this layer, along with some very small stone inclusions that probably resulted from the degradation of the natural through which the cist is cut. Both layers contained fragments of human bone, possibly some small fragments of leather, and some beads , of which OES and light blue/faience types were found in both: L102 = 29 beads: 17 OES, 7 black, 3 light blue/faience, 1 white shell, 1 black tubular/cylindrical ; L121 = 14 beads: 10 OES, 4 light blue/faience. In addition to this, ( L121) contained small fragments of ochre and a small fragment of burnt wood, which was probably a windborne intrusion. ( L102 ) contained fragments of OES and mother -of-pearl, as well as Egyptian and Pan- Grave pottery, and lithics – again, possibly intrusions. The upper fill (L100) comprised loose, yellow aeolian sand and covered the burial cut [ L103] and fill (L102). It contained the same range of material found in the lower levels, inclu ding small amounts of ochre , with the only differences being the presence of a sherd of Nubian pottery with incised decoration (pot #700 (1) | (100) | [101] | (102) | (121) | [103] | (65) | (3) | (10) (Continua a pagina 35) defined by Aaron de Souza as probably C-Group pottery, see Preliminary Report on Nubian- Style Pottery) and the heel of a very young sheep/goat (Tag6385) (see Preliminary Report on Faunal Remains) . While this consistency through the stratigraphic column is reassuring, it also indicates the possibility of intrusions throughout, bringing into question the security of assigning objects to this particular tomb . However, it does provide further evidence for the overall treatment of the bodies of the dead in the cemetery through ochre and leather. Tomb 10, Tombs 6, 8, 18, Offering Place γ and ( L65).

As recorded in F19, it seems probable that the bottom part of the feature was distur bed by post -depositional factors (e.g. modern animal tunnel) , which caused the extension of the real depth of the feature.

This feature was potentially a marker stone for the cemetery and not for a specific tomb. It seems improbabl e for a stone slab to be in this orientation (on its narrow edge) without deliberate placement . Furthermore, the northern face of the stone (receiving the prevailing wind) looked weather ed. There appeared to have been a narrow cut beneath the standing stone but a fter the removal of the slab the supposed cut turned out to be only a very shallow , irregular depression, which was probably natural, and filled by a thin layer of yellow , aeolian sand (L109=L1).

The identification of this feature being a burial is open to re-interpretation. Other than comparative features elsewhere in the cemetery, especially in terms of dimensions, there was nothing to prove or disprove that this was a burial. T15 effectively contained no finds, w ith the only exception being two miniscule fragments of bone that were probably windblown intrusions. The cut [ L134] of T15 was shallow, although almost certainly originated from a higher level than that visible today. For example, the alluvial deposit of ( L65) was not evident in this area, probably eroded by natural and anthropogenic forces. The walls of the burial cut are extremely friable, but it is clearly not a natural depression. The surviving natural layers through which ( L134) cuts are ( L3) and ( L78), with natural bedrock (L164) at the base of the feature. The fill (L133) was a yellowish- brown sandy layer with darker brown sandstone degradations, all of which represented accumulation deposits. A patch of very degraded sandstone on the northern edge of the tomb was almost certainly responsible for the colour of (1) | (124) | ?[127]? | (3) (1) | (133) | [134] | (3) | (78) (Continua a pagina 61) the fill’s matrix . This patch of degradation initially gave the appearance of a burnt area, but no ash or charcoal was present. Immediately to the northeast of T15 were F28 and F29 (see below) . To the north of T15 was a small, localised patch of reddish- brown , coarse, sandy deposit with many small stone inclusions (L110), which resembled some of the fill of T15 (L133) and was also not a burnt deposit (for example, it was markedly different to the burnt deposit of Op δ, located approximately 2 m t o the ESE) . This layer was evident once ( L1) was removed and it was atop of ( L3). It is not easy to explain this deposit because it appears to be a degraded form of (L78), which is beneath ( L3). It was suggested that it was the remnants of spoil from a nearby tomb mixed with surface san d. However, i f this wa s spoil, it is surpr ising that it was directly on top of ( L3) and would lead to the suggestion that the tomb was robbed not too long after use. Alternatively, this could be the surviving results of a natural phenomenon reflect ing patterns of wind/sand movement that we cannot currently explain. Tomb 15, Features 28 and 29.

This tomb was not excavated, although the surface level (L144) was removed and the extent of the burial was defined , revealing an aeolian sand fill (L145) within a circular cut [L146] into ( L3) and ( L10). There are stones on the southern side of the tomb, giving the appearance that a stone ring might have once been present. However, this seems unlikely and they we re almost certainly displaced from elsewhere – if n ot by natural processes, then perhaps stones were removed from T7 for a transient purpose, as encountered in the northeast of the site, such as at F9 , F13 , F16 . Furthermore, the entire northern half of the burial lacks any signs of a stone superstructure, reinforcing the interpretation of simple pit burial without surface elaboration.

(Continua a pagina 71) Trenches Two trenches were excavated at the eastern end of WT1 to investigate the extent of the cemetery. Eastern Trench At the eastern limit of the cemetery (on the northern edge of Q4B), a trench approximately 1.5 m wide was excavated from the edge of the known location of tombs eastwards (by approximately 4 m) to explore the deposits in this vicinity and ascertain the ext ent of the cemetery. The surface layer (L1) was much thinner here and overlaid a browner, sand deposit with many small -to- medium -sized stone inclusions (L112). This was notably different to the windblown sand across the rest of the site. Although no furthe r features or tombs were revealed, there were many artefacts, which included: two medium -sized fragments of leather, Ptolemaic/late Roman(?) pottery fragment, decorated PG pottery, and 241 beads (226 OES, 14 light blue/faience, 1 black) . This, combined wit h the modern intrusions (two large pieces of charcoal close to the surface and three toffee candies in wrappers), indicated that this might have been the spoil heap from nearby looting activities in the cemetery. Beneath this spoil was the alluvial deposi t of ( L3) into which several small cuts/depressions became evident; these might have been additional features (pot emplacements/offering places) or they might have been natural depressions filled with aeolian sand but they were not excavated because of tim e pressures. South- eastern Trench In the southeast corner of WT1, from the edge of T14, a trench was excavated extending further southeast to confirm that the cemetery did not continue beyond the limits of the excavation. It was approximately 2 m wide and extended for approximately 8 m. The surface level (L1) , which contained many large stones, was removed down to the more compact ( L3). Several possible features were explored but all turned out to be natural depressions in ( L3), even when surface stones suggested otherwise; L3 was very eroded in large parts of this lower -lying area . For exam ple, one cluster of stones that were located very near to a small cluster of human bones (PPA50) was thought to be situated above a burial cist but the possible feature was a natural depression with irregular edges. Bone and artefacts were recovered from t he trench but they were not associated with anything of note and were part of a dispersal of material found across the site, whether resulting from natural or anthropogenic processes.

The upper /surface natural deposits we re very disturbed in this area, so it is probable that this tomb was originally at least twice the depth of that encountered during excavation. Similarly, the diameter of the cist was smaller than expected, based on the tomb’s above-ground visibility prior to excavation (c. 1.4 x 1.1 m). No direct evidence of a superstructure to this burial was evident at the time of excavation , although there is a possibility that one did originally exist because ( L65), the ancient alluvial surface, survived in a ring surrounding most of the tomb edge but was absent through disturbance in most of the cemetery.

If T14 was a tomb, it was cut into very soft deposits and only the lower part of it survived.

As with much of the western and southern areas of WT1, ( L1) and ( L14) were mixed due to the ubiquitous disturbance (natural and anthropomorphic) , including the deposit covering these tombs . Further defining of T12 through the removal of aeolian sand upper fill ( L128) revealed that there were, in fact, two closely positioned burials ( T12 and T16), rather than a single, large one. New fill layers were assigned to reflect that there were two separate tombs – T12: ( L143) ; T16: ( L147) – and, therefore, can be considered as semi -arbitrary divisions from ( L128) . The constraints we faced on time and labour meant only one could be excavated; T12 was selected and T16 (L147) remained unexcavated but was expected to match the situation in T12 . T12 was a circular burial with no superstructure . It consisted of a cut [L129] t hrough ( L3) and ( L78), not quite to the depth of bedrock ( L164). There was some degradation to the base of the tomb, but not to the level of that encountered in T11, creating an uneven surface to the floor of the burial cist. The fill of T12 beneath ( L128) was also natural accumulation , excavated as a single, homogenous layer (L143) . The matrix of this lower deposit was the same as that above, apart from the occurrence of a lot more stone inclusions. It should be noted that t he finds from (L128) could have been from either T12 or T16 because this upper layer was removed prior to the distinction of two burials , so L143 should be considered more secure (relative to the largescale disturbance at WT1) . It appears that t here was a consistency of fin ds between (L128) and ( L143) , but it is worth noting the difference in the presence of pottery: Pan -Grave pottery was recovered from ( L128) (including a sherd from a black burnished vessel with rim (1) | (128) | ------------- | | (143) (147) | [129] | (3) | (78) (Continua a pagina 58) band marked by incised lines forming a cross-hatched motif), whereas Egyptian pottery was recovered from (L143).

It was not excavated but appeared quite large, comparable to the dimensions of the cists of T6 and T8 . It is improbable, however, that T13 was of these proportions. A more plausible explanation is that it is of a similar size to T11 and T12, suggested by the degradation of the edges of the cut [L131], particularly on the southern side, thereby creating the impression of a larger cist. T12 had a similar appearance prior to excavation. The fill layer (L130) within T13 was the same as upper fills found across WT1, comprising loose, yellow aeolian sand. No finds were recovered.

It was the eastern - most tomb in the cemetery, along with T16, which was approximately 3 m to the south; t he eastern edge of the stone ring of T8 was approximately 3 m to the west. T20 appeared to be a circular burial of a similar size to T12, which was located approximately 2 m to the SSW, and had no evidence of a stone -ring superstructure. The fill (L154), at least in the visible upper level, was of yellow aeolian sand. At this surface level, T20 was approximately 1 m in diameter, although it was probably slightly smaller once the cut of the cist [ L155] reached less disturbed levels below the surface. If it followed the same pattern as T12, it would have been relatively deep, cut into soft substrate with moderately clear edges. No associated finds were recovered. Tomb 20.

It is most probable that these features related to the tombs related to the initial core of the site and the peripheral northern burials (T4, T6–T8, T9, T18 T20).
